In an effort to begin going through my sizable math book collection, I will post 
self-contained lecture notes (with accompanying video lectures on my 
[math YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPxEP_IWPezOlK1WiQzO8tA){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}). 
The goal is so that anyone with the necessary prerequisites should be able to self-study from these notes. 

The inspiration for this undertaking comes from 
[Paul's online lecture notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
Paul's notes have been monumentally helpful for students such as myself going through
their lower-division calculus sequence. In turn, I hope that these notes are able to help
someone out there. 

*Note:* These notes are solely of my creation and as such, may contain errors. If you notice
any mistakes in my notes, please contact me via email:

Below are all the in-progress and completed lecture notes I've created:
