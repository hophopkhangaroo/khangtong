Shaped by the interests which informed my upbringing, I have always been pulled in many directions. Whether you call it hopelessly distracted or fiercely devoted to whatever sparks joy and curiosity (even if the topic changes quicker than the prevailing winds), I have time and time again converged upon three areas which continually provide a wealth of inspiration:

- Understanding the nature of the beauty and higher order function which has embedded itself in the fabric of our cosmos (mathematics)
- Training to become a better conduit for which that beauty can manifest itself in a form translatable across the human experience (music)
- Communicating the human experience across the vast intricacies and nuances that makes each of our individual worlds unique (language learning).
